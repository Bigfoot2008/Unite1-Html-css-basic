        <p class="titlepage">CHARACTER</p>
        <p class="h4">The Golden Retriever is a dog with a very sweet and endearing appearance, but is also very popular for companionship
            due to its very sociable temperament. It was selected as a retrieval dog for objects in water and on land, for the hunting
            parties of the aristocrats. It is an obedient, intelligent dogw ith an innate willingness to work; gentle, friendly and confident.

        <div class="row">
            
            <div class="columntextleft">
                <p class="h3page">CHARACTER AND TEMPERAMENT</p>
                        <p class="h5page">The Breed Standard describes it as: “Obedient, intelligent and innately willing to work; gentle, friendly and trusting”. The Golden is
                            deeply devoted to its relationship with its owner and dispenses affection to the whole family. As far as obedience is concerned, the
                            Golden has a particular propensity to willingly carry out the requests of its human friend and hardly ever challenges his wishes as
                            he is very dedicated and this leads him to interpret any command as work. He has a gentle and naive soul as he is trusting with
                            everyone and approaches strangers, other dogs and animals well.</p>

                <p class="h3page">AFFECTIONATE TOWARDS HIS FAMILY</p>
                        <p class="h5page">The Golden Retriever is a dog that adores its family of which it feels like a full member. It has excellent interaction with all
                            members of the family and enjoys living in close contact with them. It is very obedient and likes to please its owner. As you can
                            understand, it is a breed dedicated to its home and shares its days in perfect harmony with its members.</p>

                <p class="h3page">FRIENDLY WITH CHILDREN</p>
                        <p class="h5page">The Golden Retriever is friendly with children. This is a talent that it cultivates from puppyhood. One of the Golden Retriever’s
                            characteristics is that it can remain “puppy friendly” for many years while growing up. Its maturation, in fact, is completed at
                            around 3 or 4 years of age. This is a great advantage when it comes to interacting with children. However, and in spite of the
                            Golden’s wonderful character, interaction between children and dogs must necessarily take place under the watchful presence of
                            an adult.</p>
                <p class="h3page">RELATIONSHIP WITH STRANGERS</p>
                        <p class="h5page">As stated, the Golden is not a guard dog, so it does not have an aggressive instinct towards strangers. Obviously it will be
                            more active and alert in the presence of strangers. It will alert if someone or something enters its territory but will never become
                            determinedly aggressive.</p>

                <p class="h3page">SOCIALITY WITH OTHER DOGS</p>
                        <p class="h5page">He is very sociable with other dogs and, if used from puppyhood, could be friendly with other animals. He is very playful and
                            enjoys the slightest thing. He loves to play with other dogs and would be perfect if he could always have company.</p>

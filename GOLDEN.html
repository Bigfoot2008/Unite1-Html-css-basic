        <p class="h4">The Golden Retriever is a cheerful, friendly and people-loving dog.
        </p>  
        
        <p> Anyone who consciously or accidentally turns their attention to a breed such as the 
            Golden Retriever and Labrador Retriever when choosing their first dog will never regret their decision and all the recommendations regarding the risks 
            involved in choosing a breed that is "wrong" or rather not suited to the owner's personality and lifestyle, are of no particular importance because 
            the balance and the 'Breed' or 'typical' characteristics of the Golden and Labrador are truly so extraordinary that it is very unlikely that 
            you will find an unsuitable or dissatisfied owner.

            Both the Golden and the Labrador are two breeds that transmit joy and energy with a balanced behaviour, rich in emotional 
            variations and with a marked intelligence and desire to interact with their human companion.
            
            They have such a desire to interact with human beings and with an environment rich in stimuli that, perhaps, 
            this wonderful attitude of theirs could also become their fragility with respect to sterile environments and uninteresting 
            tasks such as guarding warehouses or other isolated environments.
            
            The Golden, like the Labrador, want to interact actively with their human partner and be an integral part of his life and 
            participate in his daily "routine", they are dogs suitable for families, perhaps even with children, and who live in an 
            urban context full of activities to be carried out together.
            
            They may well be excellent "alarm bells" but they are rarely deterrents because of their capacity for offence and aggressive expression.
            
            This does not mean that they are dogs without a personality of their own, on the contrary, they have plenty of personality, 
            but to this must be added qualities such as docility, intelligence, flexibility and adaptability, a great extroverted temperament, 
            with an immense desire to play and with the right temperament, neither too hard to make them too obstinate and obtuse, 
            nor too fragile to be always on the verge of a nervous breakdown.</p>

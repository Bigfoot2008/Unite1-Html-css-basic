        <p class="h4">The Golden Retriever owes much of its success to its good looks, let's say it's a dog that you fall 
            in love with at first sight, it's not for nothing that the cinema, television and press often make use of the golden.
            Usually the first thing we look at in a dog is the head, the golden's head is the dog's head par excellence 
            as any child in the world would imagine it, even if for convenience they all draw a kind of wolf dog. 
            But when you look at a golden you can't help but notice its beauty, its fantastic coat and its wonderful tail. 
            Although it is the eyes that make us fall into a kind of limbo of sweetness and definitely bewitch us. 
            Let's now take a look at its physical characteristics in a more technical way.

                            attached at eye level, the latter are well spaced and dark in colour, the look is very sweet. 
                            The muzzle is wide, high and powerful, with a length almost between the stop and the occiput. 
                            The teeth are scissor-like, with strong jaws. The truffle is black.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>The body</strong><br>
                            The body is harmonious. Back is straight. It has strong, muscular and short kidneys, the thorax is high to give 
                            space to the heart and the ribs are deep and well circled. The neck is of a good length and is well muscled.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>The tail</strong><br>
                            The tail is attached at the level of the back, straight not curved, provided with beautiful fringes.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>The limbs</strong><br>
                            The forelegs are straight, with a good bone structure, the shoulders are oblique and the shoulder blades are long. 
                            The arm has the same length as the scapula, elbows are close fitting.

                            straight when seen from behind. The feet are round like a cat.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>The coat</strong><br>
                            The coat is one of the most beautiful characteristics of the Golden to which it also owes its name, 
                            when stroked there is a feeling of softness to the touch, it can be flat or wavy, and the undercoat is thick and waterproof, 
                            which makes it suitable for water, much loved by the Golden. The coat has wonderful fringes, elegantly distributed around the edges. 
                            The colours vary from gold to cream, and should be neither reddish nor brownish.
